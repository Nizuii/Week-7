# 🦠 What is a Computer Virus?
<ul>
  <li>A computer virus is a type of malicious code or program that comes attached to a legitimate files. Once the file is opened or executed the virus runs in background.</li>
  <li>Once it gets executes it starts infecting the files and folders on that systems replicating itself.</li>
  <li>The payload in the virus has a specific task to accomplish like: Stealing passwords, destroying or deleting data etc...</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does a computer virus spread and infect systems?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Viruses can spread through removable devices like external USB drives, memory cards, external hard drives etc... if they carry infected files. When plugged into a system either these viruses can infect automatically or by executing the infected files.</li>
  <li>Email attachments or links are another common vectors for the spreading of virus. When opening the infected attachments or clicking on malicious download links and executes the virus. They can appear as legitimate files or disguised links in emails or messages.</li>
  <li>Downloading pirated softwares, free software trials or files from untrusted sources often carries embeded viruses. Downloading and installing those files or softwares leads to infection.</li>
  <li>Networks and shared files allows virus to spread between connected systems, especially if security vulnerabilities are exploited.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phases of computer virus life cycle</h2>

<ol>
  <li><h3><strong>Dormant Phase:</strong></h3></li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this phase the virus file is active in the system but nor initated or triggered. It remains inactive.</li>
    <li>It does not perform any harmful actions to the computer.</li>
    <li>Staying dormant helps the virus to evade detection by antivirus softwares until condition are right for activation.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><h3><strong>Propagation Phase:</strong></h3></li>
  <ul>
    <li>During the propagation phase the virus starts to spread itself.</li>
    <li>It replicates by copying its code to other executable files or system areas.</li>
    <li>Each newly infected files becomes a carrier for the virus, helping the virus to multipy and infect more parts of the systems and other connected systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><h3><strong>Triggering Phase:</strong></h3></li>
  <ul>
    <li></li>
