<h3>TLD (Top Level Domain)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A TLD is the most righthanded part of domain name.</li>
  Example: google.com TLD is google.com
  <li>Two types of TLD</li>
  <ol>
    <li>gTLD (Generic TLD: was meant to tell the user the domain name purpose. Ex: .com for commercial)</li>
    <li>ccTLD (Country code TLD: was used for geographical purpose. Ex: .ca for Canada)</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
<h3>Second Level Domain</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Taking google.com as an example, the .com part is TLD & google is the second level domain. When registering a domain name, the second level domain is limited to 63 characters + the TLD and can only use a-z, 0-9 & hyphens(-)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Subdomain</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A subdomain sits on the left side of the second level domain using a period to seperate it. Example: student.brototype.com the student is the subdomain.</li>
  <li>The subdomain has the same restrictions as the second level domain, being limited to 63 characters and can only use a-z, 0-9, and hyphens(-).</li>
</ul>
