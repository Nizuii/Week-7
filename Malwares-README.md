# What is a Malware
Malware is software that infects systems without user consent to steal sensitive data (bank details, passwords, personal emails), disrupt operations, or alter core system behavior. It can exfiltrate confidential information, corrupt or delete files, and impair system availability or integrity. Examples include ransomware (encrypts files for ransom) and spyware (monitors activity); mitigate risks with up-to-date antivirus and caution when opening links or attachments. Malware commonly spreads through the following vectors:

# Types of Malwares
<ul>
  <li><Strong>Viruses:</Strong> Virus is a malicious executable code attached to another executable file. The virus spread when the infected file is passed from one system to another. Virus can be harmful or they can modify or delete data. Opening a file with an attached virus can trigger the virus. Once a program virus is actives, then it will infect other programs in the computer.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Worms replicate themselves on the system, attacjing themselves to different files and looking for pathways between computers, such as computer networks that shares common file storage areas. Worms usually slow down networks. A virus needs a host to run but worms can run by themselves. After a worm affects a host, it is able to spread quickly over the network.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Keylogger:</strong> A keylogger records everything the user types oh his computer system to obtain passwords and other sensitive information and sent them to the source of keylooging program.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Phishing is another type of cyber attack to dupe or trick the victim to click on malicious links on harmful sites. The attacker crafts the harmful site in such a way that victim feels it to be an authentic site, thus falling prey to it.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> The fraudulent practice of sending text messages purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Spoofing:</strong> Spoofing is a sort of fraud in which someone or something forges the sender's identity and poses as a reputable source, business, colleague, or other trusted contact in order to obtain personal information, acquire money, spread malware, or steal data.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Its purpose is to steal private information from a computer system for a third party. Spyware collects information and sends it to the hacker.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Backdoors:</strong> A backdoor bypasses the usual authentication used to access a system. The purpose of the backdoor is to grant cyber criminals future access to the system even if the organization fixes the original vulnerability used to attack the system.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Reverse Shell:</strong> In a Reverse Shell scenario, a victim’s machine initiates a connection to an attacker’s machine, allowing the attacker to gain control over the victim’s system. Reverse Shells are commonly used in scenarios where the victim’s machine is behind a firewall or NAT (Network Address Translation).</li>

  <li><strong>Binding Shell:</strong> In a Bind Shell scenario, a malicious program opens a network port on a victim’s machine, waiting for an incoming connection from an attacker. Once the attacker connects to this open port, they gain control over the victim’s system.</li>

  <li><strong>Adware:</strong>It displays unwanted ads and pop-ups on the computer. It comes along with software downloads and packages. It generates revenue for the software distributer by displaying ads.</li>

  <li><strong>Trojans:</strong> A Trojan horse is malware that carries out malicious operations under the appearance of a desired operation such as playing an online game. A Trojan horse varies from a virus because the Trojan binds itself to non-executable files, such as image files, and audio files.</li>

  <li><strong>Rootkits:</strong> A rootkit modifies the OS to make a backdoor. Attackers then use the backdoor to access the computer distantly. Most rootkits take advantage of software vulnerabilities to modify system files.</li>
</ul>
