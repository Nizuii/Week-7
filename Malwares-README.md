# What is a Malware
Malware is software that infects systems without user consent to steal sensitive data (bank details, passwords, personal emails), disrupt operations, or alter core system behavior. It can exfiltrate confidential information, corrupt or delete files, and impair system availability or integrity. Examples include ransomware (encrypts files for ransom) and spyware (monitors activity); mitigate risks with up-to-date antivirus and caution when opening links or attachments. Malware commonly spreads through the following vectors:

# Types of Malwares
<ul>
  <li><Strong>Viruses:</Strong> Virus is a malicious executable code attached to another executable file. The virus spread when the infected file is passed from one system to another. Virus can be harmful or they can modify or delete data. Opening a file with an attached virus can trigger the virus. Once a program virus is actives, then it will infect other programs in the computer.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Worms replicate themselves on the system, attacjing themselves to different files and looking for pathways between computers, such as computer networks that shares common file storage areas. Worms usually slow down networks. A virus needs a host to run but worms can run by themselves. After a worm affects a host, it is able to spread quickly over the network.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Keylogger:</strong> A keylogger records everything the user types oh his computer system to obtain passwords and other sensitive information and sent them to the source of keylooging program.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Phishing is another type of cyber attack to dupe or trick the victim to click on malicious links on harmful sites. The attacker crafts the harmful site in such a way that victim feels it to be an authentic site, thus falling prey to it.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> The fraudulent practice of sending text messages purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Spoofing:</strong> Spoofing is a sort of fraud in which someone or something forges the sender's identity and poses as a reputable source, business, colleague, or other trusted contact in order to obtain personal information, acquire money, spread malware, or steal data.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Its purpose is to steal private information from a computer system for a third party. Spyware collects information and sends it to the hacker.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Backdoors:</strong> A backdoor bypasses the usual authentication used to access a system. The purpose of the backdoor is to grant cyber criminals future access to the system even if the organization fixes the original vulnerability used to attack the system.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Reverse Shell:</strong> In a Reverse Shell scenario, a victim’s machine initiates a connection to an attacker’s machine, allowing the attacker to gain control over the victim’s system. Reverse Shells are commonly used in scenarios where the victim’s machine is behind a firewall or NAT (Network Address Translation).</li>

  <li><strong>Binding Shell:</strong> In a Bind Shell scenario, a malicious program opens a network port on a victim’s machine, waiting for an incoming connection from an attacker. Once the attacker connects to this open port, they gain control over the victim’s system.</li>

  <li><strong>Adware:</strong>It displays unwanted ads and pop-ups on the computer. It comes along with software downloads and packages. It generates revenue for the software distributer by displaying ads.</li>

  <li><strong>Trojans:</strong> A Trojan horse is malware that carries out malicious operations under the appearance of a desired operation such as playing an online game. A Trojan horse varies from a virus because the Trojan binds itself to non-executable files, such as image files, and audio files.</li>

  <li><strong>Rootkits:</strong> A rootkit modifies the OS to make a backdoor. Attackers then use the backdoor to access the computer distantly. Most rootkits take advantage of software vulnerabilities to modify system files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Computer virus</h2>
A computer virus is a type of malicious software program that, when executed it replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its code. When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be infected. Virus can spread from one device to another when the software or document that are attached are transfered to other systems.
<h3>What does a computer virus do?</h3>
A virus can harm or destroy data, slow down system resource and log keystrokes, among other things. A virus can have unexpected or harmful outcomes during this procedure, such as destroying system software by corrupting data. Some viruses are made to mess things up by deleting files, messing up programs, or wiping out your hardware completly.

<h3>How To Prevent Your Computer From Viruses?</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Install anti virus software:</strong> Think of antivirus software as your computer's doctor. It works around the clock to detect and block viruses before they can infect your system. Make sure to keep it updated!</li>
  <li><strong>Update Regularly:</strong> Keep your operating system, software, and apps up to date. Updates often include fixes for security vulnerabilities that viruses could exploit.</li>
  <li><strong>Be Cautious with Emails and Downloads:</strong> Don't open emails or download attachments from unknown sources. If an email looks suspicious, even if you know the sender, it's best to delete it.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Protect your accounts with strong, unique passwords. Consider using a password manager to keep track of them all.</li>
  <li><strong>Backup Your Data:</strong> Regularly back up your data to an external drive or cloud storage. If a virus does slip through, you won't lose everything.</li>
</ol>

<h2>2. Computer Worm</h2>
A computer worm is a type of harmful software that copy itself and spread from one computer to another without requiring any user intervention. It's like a sickness that can move through a network of computers, searching for weaknesses to infect. Worms often spread through email attachments that may seem safe, but they can actually cause a lot of trouble. Once a computer is infected, the worm can send itself to the person's contacts, using their email account. This way, it keeps spreading to more and more computers.
A computer worm operates by finding vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. Once it infects one computer, it searches for other computers connected to the same network and spreads to them. If once they enter into the system, worms create copies of themselves and distribute those copies to other vulnerable machines. They cause a variety of problems, including slowing down network performance, consuming system resources, stealing sensitive information, or even damaging and disrupting computer systems.

<h3>How does a computer worm works?</h3>
First, a worm finds a way to enter a computer system. This can happen through security weaknesses like outdated software, weak passwords, or unprotected network ports. It may also use infected external devices, such as USB drives, as a means of entry. Once inside a computer, the worm starts replicating itself. It searches for other vulnerable systems connected to the same network or accessible through the infected computer by scanning IP addresses or probing open ports. The worm carries a payload, which is a malicious component or set of instructions. The worm delivers the payload to the infected system, allowing it to carry out its intended actions. To continue its spread, the worm aims to replicate and infect more systems. It generates copies of itself by using self-replication techniques, where it creates identical or slightly modified versions of its code then it employs various methods to distribute these copies, such as exploiting network shares or sending infected email attachments.
As the worm propagates, it may exploit network protocols and services to reach new targets. For example, it can exploit weaknesses in email programs to send infected messages to contacts in the users address book. Worms have a continuous lifecycle they are constantly searching for new vulnerable targets and adapting to changes. They evolve by incorporating new propagation techniques, updating their payloads, and exploiting newly discovered vulnerabilities. This ensures their ability to infect more systems over an extended period.

<h3>Types of Computer Worms</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Email Worms:</strong> Email worms spread through email attachments or links. They trick people into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links in emails. One of the famous example of email worm is "ILOVEYOU" worm. It spread through email in 2000, disguising itself as a love letter attachment. When opened, it infected the recipient's computer and sent copies of itself to the person's contacts.</li>
  <li><strong>Network Worms:</strong> Network worms move through computer networks by exploiting security weaknesses in network services or protocols. They infect many systems quickly by scanning and copying themselves automatically. The "Conficker" worm is a example of network worm. It exploited vulnerabilities in Windows operating systems and spread rapidly across networks. It infected millions of computers worldwide and caused significant disruptions.</li>
  <li><strong>File-Sharing Worms:</strong> File Sharing worms target shared folders or peer-to-peer file-sharing networks. They pretend to be normal files and trick users into downloading and running them. Once executed, they can spread to other shared areas or connected computers. The "Napster" worm affected the Napster file-sharing network in the late 1990s. It targeted specific songs and replaced them with infected files</li>
  <li><strong>Instant Messaging (IM) Worms:</strong> IM worms spread through instant messaging platforms. They send infected links or files to a person's contacts. By tricking users into clicking on these links, they can infect more systems. The "Kelvir" worm was an IM worm that spread through popular instant messaging platforms like MSN Messenger. It sent infected links to a person's contacts, enticing them to click and unknowingly download the worm.</li>
  <li><strong>Internet Worms:</strong> Internet worms target vulnerabilities in websites, web servers, or web applications. They can infect computers when people visit compromised websites or interact with infected web content. The "Code Red" worm affected web servers running Microsoft IIS in 2001. It exploited a vulnerability and defaced websites. The worm spread by scanning the internet for vulnerable servers and infecting them with its code.</li>
