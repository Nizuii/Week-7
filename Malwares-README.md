# Types of Malwares
<ul>
  <li><Strong>Viruses:</Strong> Virus is a malicious executable code attached to another executable file. The virus spread when the infected file is passed from one system to another. Virus can be harmful or they can modify or delete data. Opening a file with an attached virus can trigger the virus. Once a program virus is actives, then it will infect other programs in the computer.</li>
  <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Worms replicate themselves on the system, attacjing themselves to different files and looking for pathways between computers, such as computer networks that shares common file storage areas. Worms usually slow down networks. A virus needs a host to run but worms can run by themselves. After a worm affects a host, it is able to spread quickly over the network.</li>
