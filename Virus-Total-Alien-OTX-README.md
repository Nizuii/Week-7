# What’s “Threat Intelligence”?
Threat Intelligence (TI) means collecting, analyzing, and using information about potential or existing cyber threats to make better security decisions.
There are three main levels of threat intelligence:

| Type               | Description                             | Example                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Tactical TI**    | Technical details used to block threats | IPs, URLs, file hashes, signatures            |
| **Operational TI** | Info about ongoing attacks or campaigns | Which hacker group is attacking whom          |
| **Strategic TI**   | High-level insights for decision makers | Trends in ransomware or nation-state activity |

# What’s “Threat Analysis”?
Threat Analysis is the process of studying and interpreting threat data to understand what’s happening and what to do next.
If Threat Intelligence is the data you gather,
then Threat Analysis is the thinking you apply to that data.
